## Getting started

1. Open ImageTrim in a supported desktop browser.
2. Select **Import image** from the left toolbar and choose an image file from
   your device.
3. Choose a tool from the left toolbar to start editing.
4. Apply each tool's changes, then select **Export** to download the finished
   image.

The image appears in the center preview. If no image is loaded, image-editing
tools are unavailable. Importing another image or closing the current one while
there are unapplied edits prompts you to keep editing or discard those edits.

## Understanding the editor

- **Top bar:** Shows the current filename and provides pixel-ruler, animation,
  theme, and close-image controls. Select the filename to rename it.
- **Left toolbar:** Contains image import and export, undo and redo, editing
  tools, and zoom controls. On a short window, some tools may be grouped under
  **More tools**.
- **Preview:** Shows the image and interactive overlays, such as the crop
  selection or brush strokes.
- **Floating toolbars:** Crop, Resize, and Rotate controls appear above the
  preview. Drag the dotted grip to move one.
- **Dialogs:** Color adjustments and Export open a dialog. Use its **Apply**,
  **Download**, or **Cancel** controls to finish.

Tool changes that would discard pending edits ask you to confirm first.
Previews are not permanently applied until you choose the tool's apply action.

## Transform the image

Use the **Crop**, **Resize**, and **Rotate image** buttons on the left toolbar
to change the image's framing, dimensions, or orientation. Each opens a
floating toolbar above the preview. Preview the change, then apply it or
cancel it before choosing another tool.

### Crop

1. Select **Crop** from the left toolbar.
2. Drag on the image to draw a crop selection. Drag inside the selection to
   move it, or drag an edge or corner handle to change its size.
3. Use the crop toolbar to enter exact **X**, **Y**, **Width**, and **Height**
   values in source-image pixels. The crop must stay inside the image and have
   a width and height of at least one pixel.
4. Optionally select **Snap to pixel** to align the crop to whole pixels.
   Hold **Shift** while drawing to constrain the selection to a square. Hold
   **Shift** while resizing from a corner to make a square around the opposite
   corner. You can press or release Shift while dragging to toggle the
   constraint.
5. To straighten the image, use the angle slider or enter an angle in degrees.
   The crop is fitted to the rotated image automatically.
6. Select **Apply crop** (or press **Enter**) to commit, or **Cancel** (or
   **Escape**) to discard the preview.

Focus a crop handle and use the arrow keys to adjust it by one pixel. Crop
dimensions shown in the toolbar may be rounded for display; the actual
selection retains its precision unless pixel snapping is enabled. Hold
**Shift** while using a handle's arrow keys to keep the crop square.

### Resize

1. Select **Resize** from the left toolbar.
2. Enter the new width or height in pixels or percentages. The other dimension
   updates to preserve the original aspect ratio while the lock is on.
3. Select the lock control to unlock the aspect ratio and set width and height
   independently.
4. Select **Apply resize** (or press **Enter**) to apply, or **Cancel** (or
   **Escape**) to discard the entered dimensions.

Percentages are based on the image size when the Resize toolbar opens. Output
dimensions are rounded to whole pixels and each side must be between 1 and
16,384 pixels. If processing fails, the error appears in the toolbar and your
entered dimensions remain available.

### Rotate and flip

1. Select **Rotate image** from the left toolbar.
2. Use the clockwise or counterclockwise buttons to preview quarter-turns.
   Use the horizontal or vertical flip buttons to mirror the image.
3. Select **Apply rotation** to commit the preview, or **Cancel** (or
   **Escape**) to discard it.

Rotation and flips can be combined and are saved as one edit. Four quarter-turns
return the image to its original orientation.

## Paint with the brush

The **Brush** tool lets you draw colored strokes directly on the image.

### Brush

1. Select **Brush** from the left toolbar.
2. Set the stroke **Thickness** in pixels and choose a **Color** in the
   floating toolbar.
3. Draw on the image to add strokes.
4. If you make a mistake before applying, use **Undo** to remove pending
   strokes one at a time. Select **Apply** to commit the strokes or **Cancel**
   to discard them.

Brush strokes are part of the image edit once applied and can then be undone
with the editor's regular undo control.

## Adjust color and tone

The adjustment buttons in the left toolbar open dialogs. Make changes while
watching the preview, then select **Apply** to commit the result or **Cancel**
or **Escape** to close without applying it.

### Brightness and Contrast

Use the **Brightness/Contrast** button to lighten or darken the image and
change the difference between light and dark areas. Adjust either control and
review the live preview before applying.

### Levels

Choose **Levels** to adjust the image's dark tones, midtones, and bright tones.
Use the histogram and controls to set the black point, midtone gamma, and white
point while checking the preview.

### Curves

Choose **Curves** for more targeted tonal adjustments. Select the composite RGB
curve or an individual red, green, or blue channel. Add and move points on the
graph; use the keyboard or numeric fields to edit a selected point precisely.

### Color mode

Choose **Color mode** to convert the image to grayscale or black-and-white.
Grayscale keeps transparent areas transparent. Black-and-white conversion uses
a threshold and composites transparent areas onto white.

While an adjustment or Export dialog is open, the image preview is not
interactive and other editing tools are temporarily unavailable.

## Navigate the image

### Zoom and pan

- Use the **Zoom in** and **Zoom out** buttons in the left toolbar, or the zoom
  panel over the preview, to change magnification.
- Choose **Fit to window** to fit the image into the available preview area,
  or **Actual size** to view it at 100%.
- Select **Pan** in the left toolbar and drag the image to reposition it. While
  using Crop, you can also hold **Space** and drag to pan without leaving the
  tool.
- Hold **Ctrl** (Windows/Linux) or **Command** (macOS) while scrolling to zoom.
  The same modifier with **+** or **-** also zooms.

Zoom ranges from 1% to 3200%. Fit-to-window can enlarge small images as well as
shrink large ones. Releasing a moving drag can continue the pan with momentum;
reduced-motion preferences disable this effect.

### Pixel rulers and motion

Select **Pixel rulers** in the top bar to show or hide rulers that measure the
current image in pixels. Rulers are not included in exported images.

Use the animated zoom and pan button in the top bar to enable or disable
navigation animations. Your preference is saved; the system's reduced-motion
setting always takes precedence and disables animation.

## Keyboard shortcuts

Shortcuts that use the platform modifier mean **Ctrl** on Windows/Linux and
**Command (⌘)** on macOS.

| Shortcut | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Ctrl/Command + scroll | Zoom in or out around the pointer |
| Ctrl/Command + `+` or `=` | Zoom in |
| Ctrl/Command + `-` | Zoom out |
| Ctrl/Command + **Z** | Undo the last applied edit |
| Ctrl/Command + **Y** or Ctrl/Command + **Shift + Z** | Redo the last undone edit |
| **Space** + drag while Crop is active | Pan the preview |
| **Shift** while drawing or resizing a crop | Constrain the crop to a square |
| Arrow keys on a focused crop handle | Resize the crop by one pixel |
| **Shift** + arrow keys on a focused crop handle | Resize while keeping the crop square |
| **Enter** while Crop, Resize, or Rotate controls are focused | Apply the current edit |
| **Escape** while an edit tool or dialog is active | Cancel the current preview or close the dialog |
| Arrow keys on a toolbar or dialog grip | Move the toolbar or dialog |
| **Shift** + arrow keys on a toolbar or dialog grip | Move it by a larger step |
| **Home** or double-click a toolbar/dialog grip | Reset its position |

Keyboard shortcuts do not trigger while typing in text, number, or selection
fields. Crop-handle and grip shortcuts work when those controls have keyboard
focus. In adjustment and export dialogs, use the visible **Apply** or
**Download** button to confirm the action; **Escape** cancels.

## Undo, redo, and cancel edits

Select **Undo** or **Redo** in the left toolbar. Keyboard shortcuts are
**Ctrl+Z** / **Ctrl+Y** on Windows and Linux, or **Command+Z** /
**Command+Y** on macOS. Redo also works with **Shift+Z** and the platform's
modifier key.

Only applied edits are added to history; previews do not count. History keeps
the three most recent applied edits. Opening another image clears that
image's history. There is no command to reset the entire document to the
imported image, so use Undo to step back through applied changes.

## Rename and export

Select the filename in the top bar to edit it. Press **Enter** or click away
to save the name, or press **Escape** to cancel. The extension is chosen by
the export format; renaming changes the download name, not the source file.

1. Select **Export** in the left toolbar.
2. Choose **PNG**, **JPEG**, or **WebP**. For JPEG and WebP, optionally choose
   a quality preset.
3. Review the encoded preview and file size.
4. Select **Download** to save the exported image, or **Cancel** or **Escape**
   to close without downloading.

PNG is lossless. JPEG and WebP quality presets affect encoding quality; they
are not a percentage of the original file size. JPEG transparency is replaced
with white; PNG and WebP preserve transparency. Re-encoding does not guarantee
a smaller file. Export downloads the full image dimensions and does not
overwrite the source image.

The browser cannot confirm that a download has finished. ImageTrim warns when
you try to leave or replace an image with edits that have not been downloaded.

## Floating toolbars on narrow windows

Crop, Resize, and Rotate toolbars stay on one line: their controls do not wrap
into multiple rows. When the browser window is narrower than a toolbar, part
of the toolbar can extend beyond the window edge. The dotted grip is kept
within reach, but that does **not** mean every control remains visible.

Drag the grip to reposition the toolbar. You can also focus the grip and use
the arrow keys; hold **Shift** for larger steps. Press **Home** or double-click
the grip to restore its opening position. Resizing the window keeps the
toolbar near its current position and only moves it as needed to keep the grip
reachable; the toolbar is not automatically recentered when the window grows.

The Levels and Curves dialogs use compact layouts on smaller windows. If a
dialog's fields do not all fit vertically, scroll within the dialog; its title
and Apply/Cancel actions remain available. Movable dialogs can also be dragged
by their grip.

## Privacy and image formats

ImageTrim processes the image in your browser. It does not upload image data
or metadata to a server. Choosing an image uses the browser's file picker, and
export uses a normal browser download.

PNG and WebP retain transparency. JPEG does not support transparency, so
transparent areas are composited onto white. Unsupported source formats
default to PNG when exporting.

## Use the Chrome extension

The optional unpacked Chrome extension opens ImageTrim in a new browser tab.
To install it for local use:

1. Build it with `npm run build:extension` from the project directory.
2. Open `chrome://extensions` and enable **Developer mode**.
3. Select **Load unpacked** and choose the generated `dist-extension` folder.
4. Pin ImageTrim and select its toolbar button to open a new editor tab.

The extension uses the same local file picker and browser download as the web
app. It does not read images from websites or request website-access
permissions. Reload it from `chrome://extensions` after rebuilding.
